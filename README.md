# Day Scheduler

## Description

A basic day scheduler written with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, as well as Day.js, jQuery, and bootstrap. As a user you can click into a time slot to enter reminders for yourself and save them to local storage by clicking on the blue button. Depending on when the page was loaded and time of day, if a time slot is currently ongoing it will be red, if it already occurred it will be grey, and if it's upcoming it will be green. [Deployed on GitHub Pages here](https://isaiahgz.github.io/day-scheduler/).
